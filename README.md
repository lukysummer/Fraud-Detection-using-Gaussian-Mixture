# Fraud-Detection-using-Gaussian-Mixtures
Can we effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Gaussian Mixture Model?

This is my notebook using Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) Dataset, 
where the task was to **predict which transactions are fraudulent and which are not**, by looking at the 28 PCA components + transaction amount.

You can also read my [Blog Post](https://lucreceshin.wixsite.com/portfolio/post/credit-card-fraud-detection-using-gaussian-mixture-model) about this project, that briefly describes the advantages of using a Gassuan Mixture Model.
